🌱 Spring In A Box Farm Game

A cozy educational iOS game inspired by my real 5-acre farm in South Florida.
Players explore different areas of the farm — the house, garden, and learning sections — guided by friendly helper characters based on my real pets.

This app was created as part of my iOS App Development course using SwiftUI.
